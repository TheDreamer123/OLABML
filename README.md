# OLABML (Oh, look! A Brainfuck modding library!)
**No need to thank me.**

## What the hell is this?
**Didn't you think modding Minecraft was a bit too easy? I certainly did (I did not, I was just bored), so why not mod it with Brainfuck instead of something normal?**

## How complete is this thing?
**Not very, log the game, create items and blocks.**

## Why?
**"*The reason someone would do something may not always be because there's a reason, sometimes, it's a matter of why the f\*ck not.*" - Me.**

## How do I run mods made with this?
**~~Please tell me that's just morbid curiosity~~...**

***AHEM...***

**It's quite simple! Just install the library, and it will automatically look for a "brainfuck-src" folder inside all installed mods!**

**The library also creates a "brainfuck-src" folder on your game directory allowing you to create your own scripts without the need of a jar containing them.**

## I am a developer, how can I work with this?
**First of all... Why?**

**Second of all... WHY???**

**To actually answer the question to any programmer, that, for some reason only God knows, is actually serious about this, though I am praying for your sanity, I provided a [wiki](https://github.com/TheDreamer123/OLABML/wiki) to help you create your first Brainfuck mod.**

## Finally...
**To anyone else, I truly am sorry if you have to install this...**
